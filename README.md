# Digital Rain Project

This program displays a digital rain animation within the window browser, as seen in the film The Matrix (1999) or Ghost in the Shell (1995). The user can customize the animation through the menu and through keyboard inputs. Special thanks to The Coding Train for the inspiration for this project.

## Misc

The core of this program was written while I was learning JS, mostly completed on 18/08/20 and 19/08/20.

I had completed another Digital Rain animation program in Java previously, which serves as a prototype of this current program. Here is a video of the original Java project:
